    <p>Hello! My name is Guilhem De Marco, also known as nekk on the internet <br>
    I am a french student in software engineering. I've made this module in my free time while I should probably study for my exams <br>
    I've created this module to make the life of people who can't code that well easier. <br>
    I'm glad that you're using my module to make your website, I hope that what I've made is exactly what you needed</p>

    <p>Please take some time to check out some of my other projects as well, that would mean the world to me <3 </p>
